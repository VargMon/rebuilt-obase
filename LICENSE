src/ is straight from OpenBSD CVS with tiny modifications
which means they have mostly BSD/ISC licensing.

lib/libobase/ is from OpenBSD CVS, FreeBSD CVS and libbsd.

The unmarked headers in libobase/include/ are in the public
domain. Unmarked Makefiles are public domain as well as
they probably don't contain enough material to be copyrightable
in the first place.

Always refer to file header for licensing info.
