This is obase, a port of the OpenBSD userland to Linux.
You need to have OpenSSL installed to build it.

Most OS-independent tools just work, with a few exceptions:
- grep is not built because grep -F cannot be implemented on glibc regcomp.
- tail is not built because tail -f depends on kqueue.

Already ported tools are not built:
cvs less mg nc ssh sudo tmux

This is very alpha, and the tools haven't been tested very well yet.
At least the ALIGN-macro is defined only meaningfully for x86_64.
